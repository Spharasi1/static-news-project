                India and Pakistan are set to renew their rival when the two teams meet in Group A clash of the ongoing
                Asia Cup 2023 on Saturday in Kandy. For the first time ever, India and Pakistan will square off at the
                Pallekele International Stadium. The tickets have been sold out for the high-octane match, and so are
                the hotels and accommodation, in the capital of the Central Province. When it comes to India vs Pakistan
                in cricket, it is more than just a match.

                And with the emotions attached to this contest, fans from both nations are also involved in this
                cricketing carnival. However, despite the political differences, players from both teams share immense
                respect for each other.

                But, this doesn't change the fact that either team would want to end up on the winning side.

                As India and Pakistan set to go on the cricket field, here's how both teams have fared up against each
                other in the Asia Cup historically.

                India and Pakistan have met 16 times in the Asia Cup since the inception of the tournament in 1984.
                While 13 matches have been played under the traditional One-Day format, only three of them have been
                contested in the shortest format.

                While Pakistan won the previous encounter last year in Dubai, India have been the more dominant side,
                historically and in recent time.

                With four wins in the last five matches, Rohit Sharma's men have a psychological advantage over their
                bitter rivals.

                Overall, India have won 9 matches -- 7 ODIs and 2 T20Is -- as compared to Pakistan, who have been on the
                winning side just six times -- 5 ODIs and 1 T20I.
