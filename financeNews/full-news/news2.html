                Debt crisis is a matter of great concern for the world, especially developing countries, Prime Minister
                Narendra Modi has said, as India looks at building consensus at the upcoming G20 summit to evolve a
                tangible framework to help the debt-ridden low income economies. In an exclusive interview to PTI late
                last week, Modi said India's G20 presidency has placed a significant emphasis on addressing the global
                challenges posed by debt vulnerabilities, especially for nations in the Global South.

                "The debt crisis is indeed a matter of great concern for the world, especially developing countries.
                Citizens from different countries are keenly following the decisions being taken by governments in this
                regard. There are some appreciable results too," Modi said.

                "First, countries that are going through debt crisis or have gone through it, have begun to give greater
                importance to financial discipline," Modi said. "Second, others who have seen some countries facing
                tough times due to the debt crisis are conscious of avoiding the same missteps," Modi said.

                Under its G20 presidency, India has been consistently highlighting the need for a framework on debt
                restructuring to help countries facing mounting debt problems.
