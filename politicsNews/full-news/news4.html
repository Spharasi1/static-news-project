                Karnataka and Tamil Nadu Chief Ministers opposed the idea of renaming India as Bharat, even as the local
                units of the BJP slammed the Congress and DMK for their views on the subject.

                The two CMs as well as ministers and other party leaders took positions in sync with that of their
                respective political parties, further stoking the war of words sparked three days ago by young DMK
                minister Udhayanidhi Stalin’s comments over Sanatana Dharma.

                In Bengaluru, Siddaramaiah said the Constitution recognizes the country as India, and the same has been
                accepted by one and all. There was hence no need to rechristen the nation’s name now.

                His Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin, in a lengthy post on social media platform X, said, “after the
                non-BJP forces united to dethrone the fascist BJP regime and aptly named their alliance #INDIA, now the
                BJP wants to change 'India' for 'Bharat.'

                The DMK president took potshots at the BJP, saying the party “promised to TRANSFORM India, but all we
                got is a name change after 9 years! Seems like the BJP is rattled by a single term called India because
                they recognise the strength of unity within the opposition. During the elections, 'India' will chase BJP
                out of power!”

                DK Shivakumar, Karnataka’s deputy CM, told media in his hometown Kanakapura that the NDA had resorted to
                renaming the country, after being rattled by the birth of the Opposition alliance and fearing defeat in
                the forthcoming elections. “All of us are Bharatiyas. It is not correct to change the country’s name
                fearing defeat in elections,” he added.

                Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai sought to attack Stalin saying, “Secessionism is the bedrock of
                DMK. Neither India nor Bharat ever meant anything to DMK.”
