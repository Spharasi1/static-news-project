                BJP lauds 'President of Bharat' reference, says it underscores country's civilisational march

                The BJP responded positively to the use of the name "Bharat" for India in a G20 dinner invitation. The
                opposition criticized the government for undermining the idea of India as a "Union of States". </h3>

                The BJP on Tuesday reacted with delight to a G20 dinner invitation which described Droupadi Murmu as
                "President of Bharat", saying the use of the Hindi name for the country underscores its "civilisation
                march", and rejected the opposition's objections to it.

                It was some opposition leaders, including Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, who first
                highlighted the development and accused the government of assaulting the idea of the country being a
                "Union of States", as mentioned in the Constitution which describes the country as "India, that is
                Bharat".

                Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Giriraj Singh later posted on X pictures of their invites.

                Sharing a picture of his invite, Pradhan used the hashtag '#PresidentOfBharat' and said, "Jana Gana Mana
                Adhinayak Jaya He, Bharat Bhagya Vidhata".

                Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, "Republic of Bharat- happy and proud that our
                civilisation is marching ahead boldly towards Amrit Kaal."

                Rejecting the opposition's criticism, he said, "The name Bharat is mentioned in the Constitution and the
                country has been known by it for thousands of years. Our country was Bharat, is Bharat and will remain
                Bharat."

                "In this Amrit Kaal people want that their country's name should be known as Bharat. Why should it have
                an English name. What is the problem of the Congress? 'India' word was used by British. The original
                name is Bharat," Sarma said.

                Their own prince, he said, in a sarcastic reference to Rahul Gandhi, named his foot-march as "Bharat
                Jodo Yatra."

                Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that "Our country is Bharat and there should be no doubt about
                this." The Congress has a problem with everything, he said.

                Asked if the government is planning to do away with 'India' as the country's name during the coming
                special session of Parliament, he said he cannot react to speculation.

                BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh slammed the opposition, saying sometimes they have a problem with
                Vande Matram and other times they have an issue with nationalism.

                "Bharat word is not new. It has been used since ancient times. Bharat Mata and Vande Matram is in our
                blood and nothing will happen by your opposition. Bharat word is mentioned in the Constitution. New
                Khiljis and new Mughals have come who want to remove Bharat," he said.
