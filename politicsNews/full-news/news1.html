                Union Minister Pratima Bhoumik on Tuesday alleged that the Congress harmed the country more than the
                British had done. Bhoumik, union minister of state for social justice and empowerment, also claimed that
                the way the erstwhile UPA government "indulged in corruption", people would not vote for the opposition
                bloc INDIA.

                "The way the UPA had indulged in corruption, the people will never vote for the Congress. The Congress
                did more harm to the nation than the British rulers had done," she said.

                The minister also exuded confidence that her party BJP would win by-elections to the Dhanpur and
                Boxanagar assembly constituencies in Tripura. "We are sure of winning by-elections with huge margins.
                The electors of Dhanpur blessed me in the February assembly elections (2023) for the first time. This
                time too, there will be no exception", the Bhoumik said.

                She was speaking to reporters after casting her vote at a booth in Barnarayan HS School under the
                Dhanpur constituency.

                Bhoumik, as a BJP candidate, had won the seat for the first time in the last assembly elections.

                Her resignation as the MLA of Dhanpur necessitated the by-election to that seat.

                Speaking on the Boxanagar assembly constituency where voting for the by-election was being held during
                the day, Bhoumik said, "In the last assembly elections, the CPI(M) had misled voters, especially
                minority ones but this time, we were able to remove their misconception about the BJP. We are confident
                of winning the seat this time," she said.

                The minister also asserted that the country has emerged as a global leader after the successful landing
                of Chandrayaan-3 on the Moon.

                "The successful lunar mission is the testimony that the country is moving towards growth and
                prosperity," she said.

                The present government has "created an environment on all fronts to transform India into a global
                leader", Bhoumik added.
